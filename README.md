# WutheringWavesUnlock
EDIT: Not working after latest update... kind of

It actually did work on first try after updating the game but not after restarting. Its kind of fixable but also a pain so I'm probably done with this project already. Basically there used to be 2 localstorage.db files and you only had to patch the first. After the update I saw that the 2nd now needed a patch so I added support for that in my tool and lo and behold there's now a 3rd db file. This is honestly pathetic behavior from Kuro games and I'm tempted to fight it but I don't care about the game enough. If anyone wants to continue the project all assets here are free to use

shortest lived piece of software ever made but it is what it is
